# Rat in a Maze

This is a GitHub project that provides a solution to a maze-solving problem. The project aims to find a path from the upper leftmost block to the lower rightmost block in a given N*N binary matrix representing a maze. The maze is constructed with blocks, where 0 represents a dead end and 1 represents a viable path.

## Problem Description

The maze is represented as an N*N binary matrix, with the source block located at maze[0][0] and the destination block located at maze[N-1][N-1]. The objective is to guide a rat, starting from the source block, to reach the destination block. The rat is only allowed to move in two directions: forward (downwards) and rightwards.

Please note that this project focuses on a simple version of the maze problem, where the rat can only move in two directions. More complex versions of the problem might involve additional movement options or restrictions, such as moving in four directions or having a limited number of moves.
